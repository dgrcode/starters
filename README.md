# Starters

A repo to store all the configurations and packages needed to start a project

## Goal

My goal with this project is to be able quickly start a new project using any technology/stack that I've used before.

Before this project was created I always had to go back to the last project I worked on using that technology and copy all the configuration. Then I had to remove dependencies that weren't needed for the project and make sure the versions where up to date.
